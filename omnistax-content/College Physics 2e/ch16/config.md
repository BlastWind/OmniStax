# Config: College Physics 2e, Chapter 16

Proposed by the agent after exploration (2026-09-07). Status: confirmed
2026-09-07. Each line is a setting and its value. Lines that
repeat the Chapter 2 config are unchanged unless marked.

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Chapter | 16 Oscillatory Motion and Waves, modules m42239 to m42250, PDF pp. 703–752 |
| Unit of work | one section = one page; sections never folded (rule 11); 16.2 stays a page of its own |
| Order | 16.1 to 16.11 in book order; chapter intro as a short landing page |
| Loop | per section: plan message → build → stop for feedback |
| Prose | verbatim; objectives, summary, glossary pulled into views; Take-Home Experiment boxes kept verbatim as notes (new) |
| Sub-concept headers | agent decides per section, reported in the plan |
| Figures | a demo per idea or result the section introduces; every sketch and graph replaced by a demo; a photograph kept when it serves the narrative and the text, dropped when it is decoration, each listed in the plan (the Tacoma Narrows photograph is kept); no 3D expected, the chapter is planar (rule 14) |
| Demo sliders | whatever is interesting and variable in the idea (mass, force constant, amplitude, damping, drive frequency, string length, harmonic number) |
| Motion | steady oscillations and travelling waves run as an endless cycle; damped, driven and released motions are finite and get the time scrubber (new) |
| Figures that serve exercises | copied over faithfully, no sliders: the two 16.3 AP images (the pendulum pair may swing, since the question asks about frequency), the 16.9 wave and seismograph images, the 16.10 rarefaction image |
| Extra simulations | agent proposes only those that open a view the required figures do not; user picks from the plan (rule 15) |
| Feedback stops | agent waits until the user has answered every point before building (rule 16) |
| Colour coding | t, x, v, a hues carried over; T, f and ω share the time hue; amplitude and wavelength share the position hue; force and force constant get a new force hue; kinetic, potential and total energy get a new energy hue; both new hues added to `book.json` and RULES.md at 16.1 (new) |
| Inline exercises | Check Your Understanding items, after the passage they test; an untyped exercise is classed by the header it sits under (16.1's is a conceptual question) |
| Exercises tab | end-of-section problems, conceptual questions, AP test prep |
| Exercise placement | an exercise goes with the section that introduces what it tests; one placed early by the book is held for the later page (AP question 1 of 16.1 goes to 16.3) |
| AP test prep | included |
| Answers to book problems | book answer key only; never generated; unkeyed problems are left out unless the user supplies an answer |
| Suggested approaches for open questions | generated, marked AI |
| Generated questions | none; agent asks only when a concept has no book exercise testing it |
| Concept nodes | testable units only; kinds idea/result/skill; canonical ids; one concepts table in the book's `book.json` that grows across the chapter; prerequisites in Chapters 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 become placeholder nodes that open the OpenStax page until those sections are built |
| Formulas | the variables and equations tables of `ch16/chapter.json`, same shape as Chapter 2 |
| Book manifest | `ch16` added to `book.json` chapters when 16.1 is built, not before |
